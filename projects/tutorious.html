          <h3>The Challenge</h3>
          <p>I was tasked with the challenge of <strong>redesigning an app</strong> that students can use to prepare for standarized tests. The stakeholder, knowing that this app will compete with other big players in the field, wanted to keep it focused in test preparation, and at the same time <strong>target it to help low-income students</strong> that can’t afford a private tutor.</p>
          <h3>The Solution</h3>
          <p>Upon researching and refining the user requirements, the solution I came up with was an app that is <strong>easy to use, focused on the main task and usable even when the students only have a short amount of time to study.</strong> The app is still an ongoing project, so I expect that there will still be refinements, but overall we’ve seem good results among the students that have been testing it.</p>

To find out, <strong>I sent a survey</strong> to collect as much data as possible. <strong>This proof to be a challenge</strong> to find participants, but I started asking parents aqquitances about their kids and they kindly provided me with their information. After I conducted a screening interview to make sure those were the right participants, I sent the survey and <strong>these were some of the findings:</strong></p><br>
            <p>Even though these data was good, I knew I needed to dig deeper and get some qualitative data. This was because I never took that test myself, so I had to get as much information as possible in order to empathize with the users. I conducted four 1-on-1 interview to find out about behaviors and needs. </p><br>

          <h3>Takeaways</h3>
          <p>I was at the beginning of the project a bit glued to follow the user stories and flows just as I designed them. Only after the usability tests and seems real user interacting with the prototype, let me understand that these are initial guides, and  even, though some flows changed I knew this change was dictated by the user and not by my own bias. Incorporating and being flexible in changing them <strong>helped me to deliver a more cohesive design.</strong></p>

            <p>Finalized the user flows, it was <strong>time to start putting the research into design form.</strong> I first sketched the different screens on paper, then created a quick paper prototype to test at least 3 flows. I wanted to test early and often to elininate or discover any issue before moving too much forward. From this test, the data that I gathered was that is importtant to the user to know when an article was published. Right after this initial quick test, I drew the  sketches on the computer. After all the screens were done, I <strong>performed a second, and complete usability test of all the flows.</strong></p>

        <h3>Takeaways</h3>
        <p>After all this feedback, I was able to <strong>further refined the product</strong> and make it more user-centric. One of the ideas that I had with this project, was that I wanted the design to be <strong>easy to understand</strong> and I wanted the user to have somewhat the same experience as if she was using the traditional computer's desktop.</p>

          <h3>User Interface Design</h3>
          <p>When it was time to move into the design of the interface, I started by thinking again about the user. I knew I was designing for 17-19 years old high schooler. During research, most of them cited Nike, Tommy Hilfiger, Puma and Adidas as their favorite brands. So inititially I was exploring ther idea of taking cues from those app when designing to make them familiar and appealing to them.</p><br>
          <p>I spent a great deal of time iterating and trying to emulate their desings, but could not get to a point where I the design was both appealing and original at the same time. So I abandoned that idea, rethought the design was again and zero in on an interface that looked both modern and appealing, bringing to the fore front the content which was what was more important.</p>

          <h4>Brand Name</h4>
          <p>To find a good brand name for the app I used mind mapping and <strong>came out with a good amount of potential names.</strong> Then I enlisted the help of potential users to get their feedback and see what name resonated better with them. I narrowed it down to 3 after. I performed another round of preference testing and <strong>finally choose the name "Stack" for the app.</strong></p><br><br>

          <h4>Icon</h4>
          <p>For the icon, I explored different shapes. I had my personal preference but kept iterating until <strong>I finally decided to use a stackable shape that would go along with the name “Stacks”.</strong> The icon went into further iterations, and more preference test, until it was refined.</p><br><p>One of the ideas I was exploring involved the use of negative space to bring out the “S”, but time after time the users during preference testing, could not see it, <strong>so I abandoned this idea and ultimately,</strong> came up with one where the meaning was more clear and elegant.</p>

          <p>The moodboard helped me unified the brand and get even more creative ideas for the overall look of the app. Based on initial research, mostly from the 1-on-1 interviews, I noticed tha tthe potential user was someone with taste for clean and straightforward design. Keeping this in mind, I searched for these caracteristics for inspiration.</p>

          <p>The typography is a combination of serif and sans serif font to create contrast. The title of the news topics are set in serif, and the story itself is sans serif to help the user feel more comfortable when reading an article.</p>

          <h4>Icons</h4>
          <p>The main typography has a rounded feeling, going well with the rounded feel of the icon. The chosen colors are blue (meaning <strong>inspiration, creativity, and intelligence)</strong> and gray (balance, neutral). The supported icons also have a rounded feeling, playing very well with the brand. I think the approach can work very well since <strong>the user will get used to seeing the logo and will remember its meaning</strong> and associated it with the cloud storage solution.</p>

        <h3>Prototype Testing</h3>
        <p>I created high-fidelity mockups for the website that would serve to announce the app, the app itself, and the watch companion. One of the challenges I had was how far I can rethink the interface when applying color, typography and trying new layouts, that won’t deviate too much from the low-fidelity wireframe that I tested before. I did apply the changes based on the previous testing, but, overall, tried to keep the same design feel and layout design. I tested the mockup with 3 user: 2 via video conference and 1 on a 1:1 interview. Some of the changes after testing were:

            <p>On the 3 occasions that the app was tested, I noticed that it was a bit difficult for the users to deduct what this app was about by just looking or scanning the homepage. This presented a big problem since this would be one of the mediums for the public to get to know the app and understand what it does. <span class="red-circle">A</span> I had 2 “Download Now” action buttons nearby: One above the fold and the other below the fold. During testing, the users were getting confused as to which button would let them download the app or take them to the app store.<span class="red-circle">A</span>.</p>

            <p>This feature, even though it demonstrated that it was interesting to the people testing the app when was discovered while browsing the homepage, could not be well tested because of software issues.

            <p>This feature was intended to function as a way for the user to quickly get the main points of any news (condensed in 2 brief paragraphs). The way it was presented to the user testing it was that upon clicking one button, it would expand all the news in the feed at the same time and let the user browse. During testing, users pointed out that they would prefer it to open each story individually. <span class="red-circle">A</span>.</p>

            <p>I changed the behavior of the quick read feature. Instead of opening the whole feed to reveal 2 paragraphs per story, behavior that caused information overload and the user to browse a long page, now each story has a button where the user can choose to click and reveal each news as they like. They can also close it from here. A by-product of this solution was that it permitted the area of the top screen to look spacier since the 2-tabs system that existed before (“FEED” and “QUICK READ”) was no longer necessary.<span class="green-circle">B</span>.</p>

          <h2>Thoughts and next steps</h2>
          <p>This project was exciting and challenging at the same time. When I started it, I thought that I would be able to do it quickly, but I soon realized I needed to invest a considerable amount of time testing, solving challenges, and getting feedback as much as possible. It also cemented some UX concepts in my mind and made me be better prepared for the next UX projects ahead.</p><br>
          <p>It was exciting to work on the voice feature. This is one branch of UX that I would like to explore more in the future. If given more time, I would have like to perform more testing on the watch version.</p>
