        <h3>The Challenge</h3>
        <div class="summary-txt">
        <p>The client wanted a cloud storage and organization application. Even though there are other well-known companies in this field, the goal was to focus on the user having an <strong>easier interaction when saving, creating, and sharing any kind of content.</strong> By doing this, the client believed that a space can open up for this new application. <strong>Identifying the target audience</strong> was needed for this project, and also developing an <strong>identity for the brand.</strong></p>
        <h3>The Solution</h3>
        <p>Upon receiving the project and asking follow-up questions to the client, my starting point was to conduct a research to get to know potential users, then progressing to design, and finally zero in on testing, to make sure that the solution will satisfy the end-user. The final solution was an <strong>intuitive and easy-to-use app with a modern and minimalist design that invites the user to use it effortlessly.</strong> It also filled all the requirements set forth by the client.</p>

        <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
        <p>To have a <strong>better understanding of the strength and weaknesses of the competition,</strong> I conducted a competitive analysis. I spent quite some time here because I wanted to know what made these services so popular, besides their name recognition. These three competitors were analyzed:</p>

          <div class="googledrive-txt">
            <p><strong>Google Drive</strong> integrates all their services into the cloud app, but because of the amount of those services, <strong>users can get easily confused.</strong> One of the advantages that were discovered was how <strong>easy is to find any file and how easy was to collaborate.</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Dropbox</strong> I found to be very easy to use and its integration with the user’s desktop made it a “plus” feature. On the downside, it doesn't have a built-in spreadsheet creator and the <strong>functions are not consistent across devices.</strong></p>

            <p><strong>iCloud</strong> has a <strong>robust content organization feature</strong> (folder creation and color tagging), it also has a very integrated document, presentations, and spreadsheet creator.

          <p>Mark stores a lot of video clips and photos. He also collaborates with others when writing scripts and sends photos to his clients for approval. However, he does not have a lot of storage capacity because is not affordable. Because of this, he finds himself storing some files in his other Dropbox account. He is a visual person and feels frustrated that he can't tag his videos or notes by color for easy identification in any of his storage solutions. He would like to have one economical, large capacity storage solution where he can sync all of his files and organize them in folders.</p>

          <p>Renée uses Dropbox to plan all her classes and share some assignments with her students. Since she teaches many subjects, sometimes is difficult for her to understand the interface and create folders and organize all her courses. She also feels that her current cloud solution is slow when it comes to uploading high-resolution pictures and videos and also syncing with her other devices. She would like to have a cloud solution that offers an easy way to create and see folders, and also that uploads and sync in all her devices instantly.</p>
          <h4>Goals</h4>

        <h3>User Flows</h3>
        <p>To design an <strong>intuitive product,</strong> I designed user flows based on the user stories. This helped me think once more about the user and <strong>how they can accomplish their different tasks as simple as possible.</strong> Reviewing the competitive analysis helped me to refine and enhance the flows of the more established cloud storage apps that are known to users.</p>

          <p>I was at the beginning of the project a bit glued to follow the user stories and flows just as I designed them. Only after the usability tests and seems real user interacting with the prototype, let me understand that these are initial guides, and  even, though some flows changed I knew this change was dictated by the user and not by my own bias. Incorporating and being flexible in changing them <strong>helped me to deliver a more cohesive design.</strong></p>

        <p>To <strong>implement the findings of the usability test,</strong> and to apply the branding, I created a high fidelity prototype of the app that I could further test with users.</p><br>
        <p>One of the challenges I had to overcome during the low-fi prototype was the way I designed the prototype was a bit confusing to the user because there were so many screens if the user made an unexpected decision, the next screen could be something that they were not expecting. I overcame this issue by re-assembling the prototype and made the flow simpler and linear.</p>

        <h3>Branding</h3>
        <p>To start infusing personality to the brand, I started brainstorming some <strong>names that can create a connection to the main users.</strong> I also used mindmapping to help me funnel the different ideas that were coming to my mind. I settle on the idea of a spring coil and a cloud. Spring coil <strong>evoking the storage of energy and the fast or controlled release of it,</strong> and the cloud to use it as an anchor of the idea that the <strong>files can be accessed easily anywhere.</strong> To get to the logo, I <strong>studied the shape</strong> of a spring coil and a cloud. I did not want the logo to be too literal, but a nod to the components, since the name “Cloudsping”, has the meaning on it.</p>

          <h4>Typography</h4>
          <p>The main typography has a rounded feeling, going well with the rounded feel of the icon. The chosen colors are blue (meaning <strong>inspiration, creativity, and intelligence)</strong> and gray (balance, neutral). The supported icons also have a rounded feeling, playing very well with the brand. I think the approach can work very well since <strong>the user will get used to seeing the logo and will remember its meaning</strong> and associated it with the cloud storage solution.</p>

          <h4>New Document</h4>
          <p>Since one of the requisites of the project was to have a document creation option, this was provided with the most easy-to-do interface. Focusing also on sharing and collaboration, which according to the client’s guidelines and the research performed, were very important.</p>

          <h2>What I learned</h2>
          <p>This project was an excellent experience. At the beginning of the project, and while it was progressing, one of the things that were difficult to me was to <strong>see the whole picture:</strong> I could not grasp how one process would connect to the other, but now at the conclusion of the project, I can <strong>clearly see how all the pieces fit together and anchor the project through the use of a establish process in a good user experience.</strong> I also learned to “trust the process”, not just make decisions based on what I think looks good or feels right, but to <strong>consult the user at any stage of the project,</strong> and see if it’s usable to them.</p><br>
          <p>One of the things that surprised me during the testing phase was how I need to <strong>always keep in mind the user:</strong> Just because I know how something was designed or works, that does not mean the user will understand it easily.</p><br>
          <p>Given more time, I would have liked to research a bit more the competition and also to spend more time testing other components of the design. I also would like to develop an app as a companion to the website. Even though I think <strong>this product delivers to the end user and the client,</strong> I believe that it could be improved further in future iterations.</p>
