          <h3>The Challenge</h3>
          <p>The client wanted a cloud storage and organization application. Even though there are other well-known companies in this field, the goal was to focus on the user having an <strong>easier interaction when saving, creating, and sharing any kind of content.</strong> By doing this, the client believed that a space can open up for this new application. <strong>Identifying the target audience</strong> was needed for this project, and also developing an <strong>identity for the brand.</strong></p>
          <h3>The Solution</h3>
          <p>Upon receiving the project and asking follow-up questions to the client, my starting point was to conduct a research to get to know potential users, then progressing to design, and finally zero in on testing, to make sure that the solution will satisfy the end-user. The final solution was an <strong>intuitive and easy-to-use app with a modern and minimalist design that invites the user to use it effortlessly.</strong> It also filled all the requirements set forth by the client.</p>

            <p>To have a <strong>better understanding of the strength and weaknesses of the competition,</strong> I conducted a competitive analysis.

          <h3>Takeaways</h3>
          <p>By creating personas, I could think of them as real users, and throughout the project, and with every decision, I kept asking this question to myself: <strong>‘Would Mark like this feature?”, “Is this flow easy to Paula?”, “How would Renée accomplish this task?”</strong> Keeping these personas in mind helped me always think about the end user in preparation for the testing phase.</p>

            <p>To design an <strong>intuitive product,</strong> I designed user flows based on the user stories.

          <h3>Takeaways</h3>
          <p>I was at the beginning of the project a bit glued to follow the user stories and flows just as I designed them. Only after the usability tests and seems real user interacting with the prototype, let me understand that these are initial guides, and  even, though some flows changed I knew this change was dictated by the user and not by my own bias. Incorporating and being flexible in changing them <strong>helped me to deliver a more cohesive design.</strong></p>

            <h3>Branding</h3>
            <p>To start infusing personality to the brand, I started brainstorming some <strong>names that can create a connection to the main users.</strong> I also used mindmapping to help me funnel the different ideas that were coming to my mind. I settle on the idea of a spring coil and a cloud. Spring coil <strong>evoking the storage of energy and the fast or controlled release of it,</strong> and the cloud to use it as an anchor of the idea that the <strong>files can be accessed easily anywhere.</strong> To get to the logo, I <strong>studied the shape</strong> of a spring coil and a cloud. I did not want the logo to be too literal, but a nod to the components, since the name “Cloudsping”, has the meaning on it.</p>

          <p>To <strong>implement the findings of the usability test,</strong> and to apply the branding, I created a high fidelity prototype of the app that I could further test with users.</p><br>
          <p>One of the challenges I had to overcome during the low-fi prototype was the way I designed the prototype was a bit confusing to the user because there were so many screens if the user made an unexpected decision, the next screen could be something that they were not expecting.

        <p>To <strong>discover what was working after some iteration on the design,</strong> I performed a series of usability test on the high fidelity prototype. I conducted 2 remote testings over Skype and 1 in-person test. Following, the changes implemented:</p>

        <h3>Prototype Remote Testing</h3>
        <p>Supplementary to the previous user testing, I conducted a remote usability test to <strong>validate that the user could complete different tasks on their own.</strong> After the test, I found out that all the given tasks evaluated to more than 90% success. However, I discovered that during the “create document mission”, <strong>users were having difficulty in closing the document <span class="red-circle">A</span>.</strong> I implemented a change by adding an “X” to facilitate that action <span class="green-circle">B</span>.</p>

        <h3>Takeaways</h3>
        <p>After all this feedback, I was able to <strong>further refined the product</strong> and make it more user-centric. One of the ideas that I had with this project, was that I wanted the design to be <strong>easy to understand</strong> and I wanted the user to have somewhat the same experience as if she was using the traditional computer's desktop.</p>

          <h2>What I learned</h2>
          <p>This project was an excellent experience. At the beginning of the project, and while it was progressing, one of the things that were difficult to me was to <strong>see the whole picture:</strong> I could not grasp how one process would connect to the other, but now at the conclusion of the project, I can <strong>clearly see how all the pieces fit together and anchor the project through the use of a establish process in a good user experience.</strong> I also learned to “trust the process”, not just make decisions based on what I think looks good or feels right, but to <strong>consult the user at any stage of the project,</strong> and see if it’s usable to them.</p><br>
          <p>One of the things that surprised me during the testing phase was how I need to <strong>always keep in mind the user:</strong> Just because I know how something was designed or works, that does not mean the user will understand it easily.</p><br>
          <p>Given more time, I would have liked to research a bit more the competition and also to spend more time testing other components of the design. I also would like to develop an app as a companion to the website. Even though I think <strong>this product delivers to the end user and the client,</strong> I believe that it could be improved further in future iterations.</p>
