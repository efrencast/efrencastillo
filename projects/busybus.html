          <h3>The Challenge</h3>
          <p>Due to expansion, numerous bus routes of a mid-size city have been recently added and many of those routes stop at the same bus stop. Riders <strong>want to know what the next arriving bus is</strong> and <strong>how much time they have to get to the bus stop.</strong> Simply rushing to the stop when a bus is coming no longer works because <strong>it might not be the bus the rider is expecting.</strong></p>
          <h3>The Solution</h3>
          <p>This app solves the problem by providing 2 key pieces of information to the users, arrived at by research and testing: <strong>1) What is the next arriving bus,</strong> and <strong>2) How much time the user has to get to the bus stop.</strong></p>

            <p>I created user flows <strong>for both the mobile app and the watch app.</strong> Once again, I looked at competitor’s apps to get ideas I could implement or <strong>looking out for problems I could address.</strong> For me, this was a good step to empathize with the people, since the fewer steps or frictions I add to the task, <strong>the more enjoyable their experience would be.</strong> I also learned to <strong>be specific</strong> and not assume that a step was so well-known to someone looking at the flow, that I should omit them.</p>

          <h3>Takeaways</h3>
          <p>I was at the beginning of the project a bit glued to follow the user stories and flows just as I designed them. Only after the usability tests and seems real user interacting with the prototype, let me understand that these are initial guides, and  even, though some flows changed I knew this change was dictated by the user and not by my own bias. Incorporating and being flexible in changing them <strong>helped me to deliver a more cohesive design.</strong></p>

          <p>I took the rough sketches that I initially did and tried to refine them further in preparation for user testing. I planned to <strong>test directly the paper prototypes since this would give me the freedom and speed to make any changes based on the user feedback.</strong> I had to design the paper prototypes a couple of times because I wanted to make it look as presentable as possible so the sketch itself won't distract from the main actions that I wanted the user to take when testing it.</p><br>
          <p>After this was done, I tested it with 3 participants. My main goal during testing was that the <strong>iterations were easy to use that the user could perform the task successfully.</strong> These were the pain points and changes I found after testing:</p>

          <p>TI created the icons and illustrations to support the branding and to pair it with the design. I wanted them to serve as visual aids when the reader might prefer to visually interact with the app, and in the case of the illustrations, to bring familiarity and make the experience interesting.</p>

          <h3>Development</h3>
          <p>Having completed the branding and the changes after testing, I embarked on the development. Before starting to code, <strong>I sketched on paper and planned how I would approach the layout</strong> visually to properly translated it into code. This helped me to <strong>spend less time figuring out how to position various elements</strong> since I had the idea beforehand. I used GitHub to store the code and also hand-coded it from scratch using HTML and CSS. I mainly used “float” layout to position the elements.</p>

          <h2>What I learned</h2>
          <p>This project was very exciting for me because <strong>it gave me the opportunity to design a digital product using a UX process properly for the first time.</strong> I learned to “trust the process”, and correct issues when necessary to bring out a product that could be both enjoyable and usable. This project also helped to see how important is to <strong>think more inline with data feed,</strong> for example, how will this information behave or look when the information coming from a database is different than the content that I currently have? I also learned about the <strong>importance of keeping focus and stick to the MVP when is necessary to guide the project.</strong> More features can always be added later on.</p><br>

          <p>Given more time, I would have loved to produce the other screens, and maybe bring the paper prototype onto a digital environment where I can <strong>test remotely with other users or present the prototype in a medium that could look like an actual device.<strong></p><br>

          <p>All in all, I believe that everything I learned during this project can and <strong>will be applied to future and bigger projects.</strong></p>
