          <h3>The Challenge</h3>
          <p>There’s an <strong>overload of information</strong> when people try to keep up-to-date with the news. Sometimes it can be <strong>challenging to follow a particular topic</strong> from breaking news until the story completely develops. In the middle of an important news cycle, another news story can break out, thus <strong>distracting and overwhelming</strong> the user day after day.</p>
          <h3>The Solution</h3>
          <p>This app solves this problem presented above by letting users create a <strong>collection of topics</strong> using any word or phrase. These would be easily accessible on a <strong>dedicated feed</strong> and the user will be able to read all the stories based on the topic of interest, following any particular story life cycle from beginning to end, or just to have a bigger perspective of what was published about any event.</p>

            <p>I downloaded many news apps and started exploring them to understanding <strong>what they do best or what could be improved.</strong> I was also investigating if any of those apps had the features that were planned for the app I was working on. However, since analyzing all of them was unrealistic because of time constraint, I chose the top 3 apps <strong>based on the answer people gave</strong> on the following question from the survey: <strong>“What news app or website you get your news from?”</strong> </p>

          <p>By creating personas, I could think of them as real users, and throughout the project, and with every decision, I kept asking this question to myself: <strong>‘Would Mark like this feature?”, “Is this flow easy to Paula?”, “How would Renée accomplish this task?”</strong> Keeping these personas in mind helped me always think about the end user in preparation for the testing phase.</p>

            <h3>User Stories</h3>
            <p>To create stories, <strong>I referred to the goals and frustrations of the personas,</strong> and I also took a look at how some competitor’s app lets the user complete certain tasks. All these techniques helped me create stories for a <strong>visiting user, new user and returning user.</strong> In the beginning, the stories that I came up with were somewhat vague. After consulting with my mentor, who also acted as a product manager, I made the user stories more specific so that anyone looking at them could <strong>easily know what the action or task is.</strong></p>

          <p>Right after this, I created mockups to fully test all the tasks. Before putting it out to test, I did notice that my design looked too much like Apple’s design language. This was because I tried to design with Apple’s specifications. <strong>But I felt uneasy with the result.</strong> So I went <strong>back to the drawing board</strong> and I tried again to give it a more original style. I also looked at  other related apps. <strong>When I was satisfied with the design,</strong> I brought it to InVision and then to Maze to test remotely. Some of the findings were:</p>

        <h3>Usability Testing: Round 2</h3>
        <p>I created high-fidelity mockups for the website that would serve to announce the app, the app itself, and the watch companion. One of the challenges I had was how far I can rethink the interface when applying color, typography and trying new layouts, that won’t deviate too much from the low-fidelity wireframe that I tested before. I did apply the changes based on the previous testing, but, overall, tried to keep the same design feel and layout design. I tested the mockup with 3 user: 2 via video conference and 1 on a 1:1 interview. Some of the changes after testing were:

            <p>This feature was intended to function as a way for the user to quickly get the main points of any news (condensed in 2 brief paragraphs). The way it was presented to the user testing it was that upon clicking one button, it would expand all the news in the feed at the same time and let the user browse. During testing, users pointed out that they would prefer it to open each story individually. <span class="red-circle">A</span>.</p>

            <p>I changed the behavior of the quick read feature. Instead of opening the whole feed to reveal 2 paragraphs per story, behavior that caused information overload and the user to browse a long page, now each story has a button where the user can choose to click and reveal each news as they like.

        <h3>Usability Testing: Round 3</h3>
        <p>Supplementary to the previous user testing, I conducted a remote usability test to <strong>validate that the user could complete different tasks on their own.</strong> After the test, I found out that all the given tasks evaluated to more than 90% success. However, I discovered that during the “create document mission”, <strong>users were having difficulty in closing the document <span class="red-circle">A</span>.</strong> I implemented a change by adding an “X” to facilitate that action <span class="green-circle">B</span>.</p>

        <h3>Takeaways</h3>
        <p>After all this feedback, I was able to <strong>further refined the product</strong> and make it more user-centric. One of the ideas that I had with this project, was that I wanted the design to be <strong>easy to understand</strong> and I wanted the user to have somewhat the same experience as if she was using the traditional computer's desktop.</p>

          <h3>Branding</h3>
          <p>To start infusing personality to the brand, I started brainstorming some <strong>names that can create a connection to the main users.</strong> I also used mindmapping to help me funnel the different ideas that were coming to my mind. I settle on the idea of a spring coil and a cloud. Spring coil <strong>evoking the storage of energy and the fast or controlled release of it,</strong> and the cloud to use it as an anchor of the idea that the <strong>files can be accessed easily anywhere.</strong> To get to the logo, I <strong>studied the shape</strong> of a spring coil and a cloud. I did not want the logo to be too literal, but a nod to the components, since the name “Cloudsping”, has the meaning on it.</p>

          <h4>Brand Name</h4>
          <p>To find a good brand name for the app I used mind mapping and came out with a good amount of potential names. Then I narrowed it down to 3. I did some preference testing to see which one of the 3 resonated more with the participants.</p>

        <div class="moodboard">
          <h4>Icon</h4>
          <p>For the icon, I explored different shapes. I had my personal preference but kept iterating until I finally decided to use a stackable shape that would go along with the name “Stacks”. The icon went into further iterations, and more preference test, until it was refined.</p><br><p>One of the ideas I was exploring involved the use of negative space to bring out the “S”, but time after time the users during preference testing, could not see it, so I abandoned this idea and ultimately, came up with one where the meaning was more clear and elegant.</p>

          <h4>Colors</h4>

          <h4>Typography</h4>
          <p>The typography is a combination of serif and sans serif font to create contrast. The title of the news topics are set in serif, and the story itself is sans serif to help the user feel more comfortable when reading an article.</p>

          <h4>Icons</h4>
          <p>The main typography has a rounded feeling, going well with the rounded feel of the icon. The chosen colors are blue (meaning <strong>inspiration, creativity, and intelligence)</strong> and gray (balance, neutral). The supported icons also have a rounded feeling, playing very well with the brand. I think the approach can work very well since <strong>the user will get used to seeing the logo and will remember its meaning</strong> and associated it with the cloud storage solution.</p>

I wanted them to serve as visual aids when the reader might prefer to visually interact with the app, and in the case of the illustrations, to bring familiarity and make the experience interesting.</p>

          <h3>Preference Test</h3>
          <p>I performed various preference testing to evaluate which design was better for a particular screen.</p><br>
          <p>The feedback I got from the preference test was invaluable since besides deciding on the options, I could discover other issues: Users not understanding certain components of the design unrelated to the preference that they were performing. That allowed me to empathize with them once again and make the necessary changes.</p><br>
          <p>For example, one of the struggles I had as the interface designer was how to clean the top portion of the news feed screen, and thanks to the input of some users, I devised a better way to display those buttons.</p>
