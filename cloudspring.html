      <H2>Project Summary</h2>
      <h3>The Challenge</h3>
      <p>The client wanted a cloud storage and organization application. Even though there are other well-known companies in this field, the goal was to focus on the user having an <strong>easier interaction when saving, creating, and sharing any kind of content.</strong> By doing this, the client believed that a space can open up for this new application. <strong>Identifying the target audience</strong> was needed for this project, and also developing an <strong>identity for the brand.</strong></p>

     <h3>The Solution</h3>
     <p>Upon receiving the project and asking follow-up questions to the client, my starting point was to conduct a research to get to know potential users, then progressing to design, and finally zero in on testing, to make sure that the solution will satisfy the end-user. The final solution was an <strong>intuitive and easy-to-use app with a modern and minimalist design that invites the user to use it effortlessly.</strong> It also filled all the requirements set forth by the client.</p>

      <h3>The User Research</h3>
      <p>To get to know the user, <strong>I used a survey</strong> as a method to do the primary user research. My main focus was to <strong>know the user’s priorities</strong> when using a storage service, as well as <strong>features they like or dislike,</strong> and how this web app could <strong>help them in their everyday life.</strong></p>
      <p>There were some of the findings:</p>

      <!-- aside -->
      <aside>
        <p>51% Use for personal or professional reasons.</p>
        <p>52% Create documents and spreadsheets.</p>
        <p>100% Collaborate by sharing a link.</p>
        <p>38% Organize content by categories, tags or folders.</p>
        <p>71% Collaborate with families or co-workers.</p>
        <p>71% Upload and stores videos or files.</p>

        <h4>Key Takeaways</h4>
        <p>At the end of this research, I discovered that the potential user was someone that was <strong>experienced in using a cloud application.</strong> I also learned that the user is a <strong>frequent user</strong> of this kind service to accomplish their needs.</p>

      <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
      <p>To have a <strong>better understanding of the strength and weaknesses of the competition,</strong> I conducted a competitive analysis. I spent quiet some time here because I wanted to know what made these services so popular, besdies their name reconigtion. These three competitors were analyzed:</p>
      <!-- google drive -->
      <img src="/media/images/google-drive-logo.svg" alt="Google Drive Logo">
      <p><strong>Google Drive</strong> integrates all their services into the cloud app, but because of the amount of those services, <strong>users can get easily confused.</strong> One of the advantages that was discovered was how <strong>easy is to find any file and how easy was to collaborate.</strong></p>
      <!-- dropbox -->
      <img src="/media/images/dropbox-logo.svg" alt="Dropbox Logo">
      <p><strong>Dropbox</strong> I found to be very easy to use and its integration with the user’s desktop made it a “plus” feature. On the downside, it doesn't have a built-in spreadsheet creator and the <strong>functions are not consistent across devices.</strong></p>
      <!-- icloud -->
      <img src="/media/images/icloud-logo.svg" alt="iCloud Logo">
      <p><strong>iCloud</strong> has a <strong>robust content organization feature</strong> (folder creation and color tagging), it also has a very integrated documents, presentations and spreadsheet creator. As a minus, the service <strong>is not seems very professional,</strong> since it gives the impression that is geared towards personal use rather than professional.</p>

        <h4>Key Takeaways</h4>
        <p>By analyzing the competition, I could acquired the necessary knowledge of <strong>what regular users experience</strong> when using other applications, as well as what <strong>was missing or what could be enhanced</strong> for the client’s app.</p>

      <h3>User Personas</h3>
      <p>Upon <strong>analyzing the user survey,</strong> it was time to <strong>bring empathy to this data.</strong> I accomplish this by crafting 3 different user personas.</p>

      <!-- mark abernathy -->
      <img src="/media/images/mark-abernathy.png" alt="A picture of user persona Mark Abernathy">
      <p><em>“I would like to store all my files in one place, access them anywhere and easily find them”</em></p>
      <h5>Mark Abernathy</h5>
      <p>32 years old</p>
      <p>Assistant Video Editor</p>
      <h4>Motivations</h4>
      <p>Mark stores a lot of video clips and photos. He also collaborates with others when writing scripts and sends photos to his clients for approval. However, he does not have a lot of storage capacity because is not affordable. Because of this, he finds himself storing some files in his other Dropbox account. He is a visual person, and feels frustrated that he can't tag his videos or notes by color for easy identification in any of his storage solutions. He would like to have one economical, large capacity storage solution where he can sync all of his files and organize them in folders.</p>
      <h4>Goals</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Have a large capacity storage for all his data.</li>
        <li>Create folders, and tag files and notes by color.</li>
        <li>Save or create a file and see it on all his devices.</li>
        <li>Collaborate with other.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Frustrations</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Can’t easily identify his videos or notes.</li>
        <li>Low capacity cloud solution.</li>
        <li>Has to keep two accounts for capacity reasons.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><em>“I need my devices to be easy to use and have all my assignments ready to share with my students”</em></p>
      <h5>Renee Palmer</h5>
      <p>45 years old</p>
      <p>Teacher</p>
      <h4>Motivations</h4>
      <p>Renée uses Dropbox to plan all her classes and share some assignments with her students. Since she teaches many subjects, sometimes is difficult for her to understand the interface and create folders and organize all her courses. She also feels that her current cloud solution is slow when it comes to uploading high resolution pictures and videos and also syncing with her other devices. She would like to have a cloud solution that offers a easy way to create and see folders, and also that uploads and sync in all her devices instantly.</p>
      <h4>Goals</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>To understand the interface to get things done.</li>
        <li>To easily create folders to organize her projects.</li>
        <li>To upload and sync her files quickly.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Frustrations</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Spent too much time trying to find features.</li>
        <li>Can’t create easily folders.</li>
        <li>Can’t upload and sync fast.</li>
      </ul>

      <aside>
        <h4>Key Takeaways</h4>
        <p>By creating personas, I could think of them like real users, and throughout the project, and with every decision, I kept asking this question to myself: <strong>‘Would Mark like this feature?”, “Is this flow easy to Paula?”, “How would Renée accomplish this task?”</strong> Keeping these personas in mind helped me always think about the end user in preparation for the testing phase.</p>

      <h3>User Stories</h3>
      <p>In order to <strong>design with the user’s perspective in mind,</strong> I moved on to create user stories based on the information collected on the user survey and also data from the personas. The priorities considered where for a new and returning user. I designed for all the high priorities and some medium and low priorities too.</p>

      <!-- table for user stories -->

      <h3>User Flows</h3>
      <p>To design an <strong>intuitive product,</strong> I designed user flows based on the user stories. This helped me think once more about the user and <strong>how they can accomplish their different tasks as simple as possible.</strong> Reviewing the competitive analysis helped me to refine and enhanced the flows of the more establish cloud storage apps that are known to users.</p>

      <aside>
        <h4>Key Takeaways</h4>
        <p>I was at the beginning of the project a bit glued to follow the user stories ans flows just as I designed them. Only after the usability tests and seems real user interacting with the prototype, let me undertand that these are initial guides, and  even, though some flows changed I knew this change was dictated by the user and not by my own bias. Incorporating and being flexible in changing them <strong>helped me to deliver a more cohesive design.</strong></p>

      <p>Finalized the user flows, it was <strong>time to start putting the research into a design.<strong> I first sketched the different screens on paper, and drew them on the computer. After all the screens were done, I <strong>performed the first usability test to see how this attempt performed.</strong></p>
