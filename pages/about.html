        <h3>Arriving at UX has been a journey:  From drawing to architecture, to graphic design and finally UX.</h3>
        <p>There’s an episode in my life that I vividly remember. I must have been around 7 years old. I traveled from my small hometown (Bani) to Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic. The lights, the traffic, the big avenues, the big billboards… everything caught my attention. <strong>That’s where my love for design, communication, urbanism, and architecture was born.</strong></p><br>
        <p>I remember playing in my house’s backyard, "constructing" cities and highways using dust and wooden bridges to play with my small Hot Wheels cars. Later on, I started designing, drawing and painting 80’s cartoons inspired robots on pieces of corrugated fiberboards, I would later collect them in old cracker boxes.</p><br>
        <p>After graduating from high school, <strong>I decided to pursue my passion: I traveled to the Dominican Republic from NYC to study architecture.</strong> In a period of 3 years I learned about great architects and their works, and more important, I learned the process of designing spaces for humans’ needs and scale by designing the blueprint and models of various projects (Public library, discotheques, modeling agencies), producing all the necessary spaces, <strong>studying their dimensions in relationship with the users, and how they will move or interact with the building once inside.</strong> Sadly, I could not finish the degree since I had to come back to the United States due to family reasons.</p><br>
        <p>At this point in my life I had to decide: <strong>Continue studying architecture or switch careers?</strong> Completing my degree in a university was out of reach because of the tuition cost. But "when there’s a will, there’s always a way". Architect Frank Lloyd Wright once said: <i>“The mother art is architecture”</i>. Well, I was happy then to hang out with one of its offsprings: <strong>I enrolled in college to study graphic design, and by studying typography, photography and illustration, it all reaffirmed my belief that design in general was my passion.</strong></p>
        <h3>Why is design so important to me?</h3>
        <p>Is a form of self-expression, but also <strong>a way to communicate ideas to others and solve their problems.</strong> No matter in what field design is being used, it always <strong>connects and serves human needs in ways that matters,</strong> all arising by the designer's ideas and profound interest of said humans.</p>
        <h3>How this journey took me to UX design?</h3>
        <p>During my years practicing graphic design, I thoroughly enjoyed designing layouts, logos and branding, I even learned to code websites, but my curiosity for all creative-things let me discover UX, which is a field that encompasses so much following an orderly process: Research, design, and caring deeply for the user’s needs. The more I read about this field, the more <strong>I realized that UX can help me grow and expand my passion for design and all together, visual communication.</strong></p><br>
        <p>Just as I was inspired as a kid by visual arts, <strong>I want to inspire and influence others,</strong> either by solving their communications problems through a user-centered approach or by directly helping others appreciate or discover their own passion.</p><br>
        <p><strong>Thanks for reading!</strong></p>
